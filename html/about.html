            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>G’day, my name is Gerry, the founder of Green.En.Kids.</p>
            <p>
              I care deeply about our natural environment. I am passionate about
              ensuring our ecosystems are preserved and sustained so that future
              generations can enjoy the many benefits it has to offer.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is essential that we equip our young people with the knowledge
              and skills to care for the natural environment. But more
              importantly to inspire and empower them to make a difference today
              and into the future.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe that music is a universal gift, a language that speaks
              to everyone, a powerful way to convey meaningful messages that
              strikes a chord on so many levels.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through Green.En.Kids, I hope to plant the seeds of curiosity,
              care, and action in young minds—so they grow into passionate
              protectors of our planet. This is the legacy I want to leave
              behind: a generation of kids who understand the value of nature
              and are inspired to make a lasting difference.
